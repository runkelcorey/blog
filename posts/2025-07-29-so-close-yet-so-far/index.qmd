# The first wrinkle

In [my last update](../2025-05-04-too-slowly/index.qmd), I decided to service my pedals.
The next Tuesday, I walked (ugh) to Somerville Bike Kitchen for the umpteenth time and spent 2 hours stuck on step 1:

!["Remove dust cap from Campagnolo pedal"](https://cycling-obsession.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9123.jpg)

Through this experience, I relearned a fundamental law of bicycle maintenance:
>A component assembled for a half century tends to stay assembled unless acted upon by a purpose-built tool.

What was true with my headset remained true with this pedal dust cap.
However, the internet spoke of a "special dust cap wrench to remove them."
Of course, it's been 50 years so I was skeptical I could find such a wrench; the usual suspects---eBay, Reddit, [the Bike Peddler](https://www.bikepeddler.com), [Cicli Berlinetta](https://cicli-berlinetta.com), and [Classic Steel Bikes](https://www.classicsteelbikes.com)---turned up nothing.
But some digging turned up [the MKS Dust Cap](https://www.mkspedal.com/?q=en/product/node/165):

This little \$6 tool was "designed to remove the dust cap from BM-7, Sylvan series , and Sylvan Prime series of pedals".
And it just so happens to exactly fit Campagnolo Record Strada pedals.

# The second wrinkle

After 2 weeks, I had successfully disassembled the pedals, leaving a new mess that looked like this but greasier:

![](https://cycling-obsession.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_9152.jpg)

I put everything through another round of degreasing and set to work reassembling.
I expected the worst after seeing this in the instructions:
>This next step will usually require a number of repetitions to achieve the perfect bearing tension setting regardless of how many times you have done it before.

However, I found repacking bearings to be pretty straightforward.
Yes, it required re-doing but it's reversible, so it forgives the beginner.

# The third wrinkle

Unfortunately, I discovered damage in one of the bearing races, which resembled a keyhole rather than a circle:

This may not have affected performance; but I did not come this far to put a damaged pedal back together.
Back to Reddit.
The same helpful Redditor who fixed me up [a Phil Wood bottom bracket](../2025-04-26-slowly-but-surely/index.qmd) saw my post and reached out, finding me [a deal](https://bikerecyclery.com/nos-nib-campagnolo-nuovo-record-sl-strada-pista-pedal-race-set-2-races/) from a vintage reseller I had never heard of, [Bike Recyclery](https://bikerecyclery.com/).
I bought them, got them, and immediately realized they the wrong part.
(Side note, I never heard back from them after I explained this....)
Undeterred, the Redditor quickly found an eBay listing that met my needs.
I added small nuts to a bearing press and fit the race in.

# The fourth wrinkle

Packing up, I have no idea if I put the correct number of bearings in each pedal.
I tried to distribute them by putting 11 in one side and 12 in another but somehow I never got them to match.
This was painstaking work and I ended up repacking each pedal's outer race because the spindle inevitably touched a greased bering, bringing the whole greasy enterprise with it.
Satisfied with the quiet, smooth spin, I proceeded to thread the pedals on...only to realize I had put the right spindle on the left pedal and the left pedal on the right spindle:

![`S` for *sinistra*; the right pedal has `D` for *destra*](images/wrong%20shoe.jpeg)

These pedals aren't symmetric---there are little fangs on the back of these that you don't want facing front, plus the toe cages I had become fond of don't fit on the back.
So, I did the only thing I could do, which was wallow in defeat for a week and then repeat the whole process.

# Oh yeah, about those decals

Since our last post, I also put on the H Lloyd Cycles decals.
They look great but I really *really* should have asked Pike Powdercoat to put them on before they added a topcoat.
These are unprotected white and aren't going to last very long.
Still, they were only moderately finicky and I only moderately messed them up.

# Wrapping up

Chain and shifters went on with an acceptable amount of bull-in-china-shop bumblery and, as of 2 weeks ago, the bike is rideable!
I present the new, improved, Wester Ross frame #015:

I hopped on and all sounded well until I put the power down.
My chain immediately slipped, signaling that the freewheel needs replacement too.
For next time ðŸ™ƒ
