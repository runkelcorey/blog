![1987 Schwinn High Sierra (not mine)](https://preview.redd.it/picked-up-this-87-schwinn-high-sierra-and-shes-a-beaut-v0-y7mifaaxjv2e1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ccb00490b354749d311609fa3e88af3646b6dfbd)

This is what I want to replace my titanium VooDoo Loa.
Now, I know what you may be thinking.
Rim brakes?
26" wheels?
*A riser stem?*
Where's the elegance that the VooDoo---not to mention the Wester Ross---is capable of?

The Schwinn doesn't turn heads; in fact, some components look intentionally clunky.
It's also heavy, maybe as much as 10 pounds more than my VooDoo!
But it's heavy because it's meant to haul, sporting as many mounts as any bike this side of a Salsa.
It's also heavy because of the brakes it sports: SunTour rollercams.

These are really easy to miss when you just see the bike in profile but impossible once you really look at them once.
The first impression---what is *that*---gives way to a satisfying feeling of understanding, immediately, how they operate: the center piece, hauled by a brake cable, forces each arm outwards at the top and inwards along the rim.
Sheldon Brown [notes](https://www.sheldonbrown.com/canti-rollercam.html) that these brakes are not only sturdy and powerful but are quicker to engage than clap down, kind of a reverse of a cantilever.
The result is that riders get most of the stopping power early in the brake lever pull, saving forearms without sacrificing tire clearance or stopping power.

Ultimately, these brakes are what tipped this bike over the edge for me.
I think they look amazing and but they're such a small piece that they're easy to miss.
That's important to me because 90% of this bike's life will be in the city and I like not worrying about would-be thieves eyeing my wheels.
My friends have lovely steel and carbon disc-brake steeds and they're always nervous about hopping into a cafe, let alone locking it up for hours at a time.
To have a bike that I can forget about is one of those luxuries of anachronisms that we often overlook.

Beyond these brakes, I was looking for something a lot better at hauling things and a lot less similar to the Wester Ross.
After my 2-year dalliance with the VooDoo, I realized that I also wanted a bike fit for a smaller rider and one that would let me pedal through twisty singletrack.
Together, that adds up to less wheel, a 26er or a 650b machine rather than 700c/29".
Luckily, moving to 26" opens up a lot of cheap options, a whole pool of Marketplace I had never waded into.

Importantly, I want to switch the cockpit to use drop bars.
I love the form of drops---their twistiness reminds me of handbuilt stuff---as well as their function---long rides make good reasons for multiple hand positions.
This intent, however, narrows the options widened by the decision to run 26" wheels.
The right bike has limited reach and a higher stack to compensate for the longer reach of drop bars.
I found loads of folks who made this work online, which gives me confidence to do the same myself.

I want this bike to be my ~~daily~~ twice-weekly commuter, my bikepacking rig, my grocery basket and, eventually, a kiddo wagon.
To make that work, I'll need to make some changes:
- a nice big front rack for bags and baskets
- fenders to protect everything
- water resistant-ish components, like a Brooks Cambium
- clearance for rear racks
- the knobbiest tires I can persuade myself to ride over Cambridge's streets

I'm excited by the options this opens for moving stuff and just need to wait out the eBay/Craigslist/Marketplace options so that I can find the right option.
I do worry that that this frame, with the smallest size sporting an 18" seat tube, will still have the same problems as my VooDoo.
However, this time I'm more willing to compromise (I'm currently giving myself exposure therapy to riser stems and weird old [dirt drops](https://theradavist.com/1983-steve-potts-dirt-drop)) and don't feel I have as much aesthetics to ruin with practical choices.

Right now, I've got all the possibilities and none of the practical issues.
Let's hope it stays that way.
