I learned to ride a bike just before I moved to New Haven.
Living in a city, abandoning my boring, dangerous, radio-less car seemed like a great statement to make about myself and the world I wanted to see.
Unfortunately, Amtrak is *expensive* and going rock climbing or hiking in the White Mountains is pretty hard without a car.
But, I still became the cyclist I hoped to be.
If the roads are dry, I bike.

I've proudly assembled the lobster gloves, under-helmet hats, and merino wool to make windchills in the single digits tolerable.
And I try to limit my car trips to groceries and Boston (where the ol' partner lives).
But more than a statement about my identity, I'm compelled to bike because it gives me the joy that I missed out on in childhood.
Navigating a city quickly, by my own legs, with the wind cooling me down, is a lot of fun.
(It's even more fun when your bike is made of vintage Campagnolo and leather.)

And getting outside, especially in the depths of covid, was tolerable when I first found the Farmington Canal Trail.
Running 84 miles from New Haven to Northampton, the trail is a piece of functional history; lining its sides are locks from the old canal, while its right-of-way was secured after the advent of cars by the railroad that ran followed the canal.
I'd gone on sit bone--shattering 46 milers on the Farmington, but never ventured past Southington, CT, where the trail peters out and cyclists must brave the road to catch the northern section up to Massachussetts.
Still, the first time I got on the Farmington I knew that I would one day cycle the whole thing.

To make the trip worth it to my list-obsessed brain, I decided to add a bit and make it an even 100 miles---a proper *century*.
And to make it easier on myself, I decided to stop along the route often, to relieve my body and enjoy the delights of New England.
Weirdly, not a whole lot of online types seem to have done this, so I'm sharing my journey here.


## Route

With the Farmington proper being 84 miles, and with numerous road excursions, the route is far from a foregone conclusion.
I further maximized this trip by adding the 5-6 mile Farmington River Trail spur, a detour that cuts through the charming towns of Simsbury and Canton, and gives the rider more to look at than trees and twigs.
On the Massachussetts end, cyclists are confronted with the paved end of the trail in Westfield, short of the original canal.
Having seen and been charmed by Northampton, I decided to continue there for my add-on.
They're an oasis for food and beer, two post-ride necessities.

However, this leaves 10-15 miles to spare.
If you can manage it, I suggest finding a way to move your bike from the Norwottuck Rail Trail to the Springfield Amtrak station, which allows you to continue without facing cars and see Amherst, MA.
This route also shows the killer app of the Farmington Canal century: it's a point-to-point where you leave your car at home.
In Springfield, just bring your bike on the train, which is free if you take CTrail, adding up to a whopping \$10 from Springfield to New Haven!
Of course, if you don't have a friend, you can go totally carless and double back from Northampton to Springfield for the add-on, which adds maybe 8 miles and sees some on-road action.
