I recently finished a job search.
Starting May 5, I'll be a Data Analyst for Kin + Carta's Cascade Data Labs!
It was so exciting to get this offer because it validated my beliefs in my self-taught skills and the direction that I decided to head in.
It'll continue to excite by sautéeing me in new tools and give me the time to marinate in data science more generally.^[I've been watching [*Julia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_\(2022_TV_series\))]

So, it's a bit weird that I'm now investing time in creating personal branding.
I had intended that this time would give me a leg up on other applicants, but now I realize that it let's me scratch an itch I forgot I had.
Plus, with the new job, I feel that I can be a *bit* more adventurous in design---the acute pain of rejection had whittled my design instincts into conservativity.

I started (as I seem to always do now) by writing a procurement contract for myself.
The personal branding must:

* be distinctive (if not unique)
* unify, at the very least, a résumé, a cover letter, and a business card
* use open-source tech
* play nice with the automated realities of networking/applying today
* demonstrate and develop my skills
* leave open the possibility of adding other document types
* ease portability between PDFs, this website, LinkedIn, and GitHub

Unfortunately, I didn't look too closely at the possibility of this last requirement; LinkedIn [doesn't seem to allow](https://medium.com/swlh/the-frustrations-of-dealing-with-the-linkedin-api-747147c95eac) people to edit their own info via API.
This fact is particularly disappointing since Microsoft owns LinkedIn and has stated it's open-source intentions.
But, que sera sera.
To fulfill the rest of my requirements, I turned to TeX.
I currently use TeX for all my résumés and cover letters, but I decided my new template could afford to be more daring than Trey Hunner's [classic template](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume).
And, it would have to be more distinctive than [Deb Das](http://debarghyadas.com/)' [ubiquitous CV](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume).

But, only a little bit.
The new template is just two steps removed from Das' CV, the first being Shubham Mazmuder's [PlushCV](https://github.com/sansquoi/PlushCV), and the second being some lines injected from Andy Bernard's [non-repoducible example](https://www.behance.net/gallery/134696793/Modern-Resume-Template-CV).^[You'll notice that I've mentioned the names here, and that's because they're stuck in my head! When you make a résumé template, you enjoy the benefit of other's learning all about you.]
An important, practical change was the substitution of ligatures and other glyphs for unicode symbols.
Applicant-tracking systems struggle with LaTeX documents because of these features, though it pains me to remove them.
I'm also keeping the same fonts throughout, a habit from my own yearbook days that is compatible with the minimalist, quiver-of-one idealism that I'm bringing to this whole endeavor.
Naturally, the fonts must be open-source, so I'm using Adobe's [Source Sans Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans) and [Source Code Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Pro).^[You may have noticed I've changed this blog's typeface from IBM Plex to Source; I've learned from this process that IBM Plex is a bit too IBM-er for me.]

Developing the résumé was easy enough, given how little I changed things:

The cover letter was easy too; just remove the sections, add a signature, and, voilá!

The business card?
A little more involved.
I found a [fantastic introduction](https://olivierpieters.be/blog/2017/02/11/designing-a-business-card-in-latex) to business cards in LaTeX, with a great little bit about designing a QR code linked to my own vCard (something that can be scanned easily if you keep such things in a transparent phone case)s.
Initials add a bit of class to the whole affair, and doesn't carry a lot of consequences given how seldom they are used.

Last, to make these even easier to edit, I created global options used across the media.
This allows users to change fonts, colors, and contact information without doing so for each document.
