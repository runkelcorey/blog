How much rust is too much?
I need to answer this question before I invest time and money in restoring my Wester Ross road bike: if the frame is, or will soon be, compromised by oxidation, then my restoration won't be rideable!
Ideally, I'd make my decision by weighing the expected enjoyment I'd get out of a restored bike against the expected cost of its restoration and proceed with restoring if $E[enjoyment] > E[cost]$.
With the internet, the costs are easy to estimate:

| component            |       cost |
|----------------------|-----------:|
| Sandblasting         |       $100 |
| Powdercoating        |       $300 |
| Adding mount points  |       $200 |
| Decals               |        $20 |
| New cables & housing |        $30 |
| New saddle           |       $100 |
| New bottom bracket   |        $40 |
| Fenders & tires      |       $150 |
| New cassette         |        $60 |
| Rust protection      |       $100 |
| Racks & bags         |       $300 |
| **Total**            | **$1,400** |

For \$1,400, I'd want at least 5 years of use out of the frame.
