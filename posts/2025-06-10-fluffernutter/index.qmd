When I moved to Cambridge, I had never heard of the Fluffernutter.
If you don't know what it is, thank you, I take comfort in that.
The Fluffernutter is:

- 1 part marshmallow creme
- 1 part peanut butter
- 2 parts bread

Folks around here take great pride in this sticky sandwich, for [an enterprising woman created the Fluffernutter here in the 1910s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluffernutter#History).
Here, the Fluffernutter recipe is slightly more specific:

- 1 part Marshmallow Fluff
- 1 part Teddie's Peanut Butter
- 2 parts bread

![Marshmallow Fluff and Teddie's Peanut Butter](https://sarahwormannart.com/cdn/shop/files/fluffernuttercardart.jpg)

Both of these ingredients are still manufactured less than 10 miles from my home in Cambridge.
Peoples' allegiances run so deep that Somerville hosts an annual Fluff Festival to celebrate the local legend.

As for me, I had my first Fluffernutter---the canonical recipe, of course---a mere 2 weeks ago.
Growing up, I never heard of the delicacy, but the fun design of the Marshmallow Fluff logo and the superiority of Teddie's Peanut Butter convinced me to give it a try.
It's a great snack, a filling snack, and, like all great snacks, it's remixable; if you want more substance, just add banana slices; if you want luxury, spread on some nutella; if you want insanity, [add pickles](https://mubi.com/en/us/films/pb-p).

Since I tried it, I have asked friends and family and coworkers where they grew up and when/if they had heard of a Fluffernutter.
Here were the results by childhood home:

- Ohio: 1 yes
- Virginia: 3 Nos
- California: 1 yes
- Oregon: 1 no
- New York: 1 no
- Ontario: 1 yes
- Massachusetts: 4 yes

Clearly Bay Staters know their fluff but the rest of the country is a mixed bag.

This is, [in fact](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleI/Chapter2/Section35), our official demonym. I don't hate it but it feels like giving up.

I'm troubled without patterns to guide my mental model building, so I'm going to answer the question: how New England is the Fluffernutter sandwich?
Had I vast survey resources at my disposal, this would be trivial.
I would simply measure how many people per capita think about a Fluffernutter each day and check if the:

1. New England average is higher than the rest of the country; if this isn't true, then the Fluffernutter is not a regional specialty.

::: {.column-margin}
$$
\mu_{New England} > \mu_{US\ exc.\ New England}
$$ {#eq-1}
:::

2. intra--New England variance is lower than the rest of the country combined

::: {.column-margin}
$$
\frac{\sum(x_s - \mu_{NE})^2}{n-1} < \frac{\sum(x_s - \mu_{US})^2}{n-1}
$$ {#eq-2}
:::

If 1 is true but not 2, then we conclude that the Fluffernutter may be a Massachusetts thing but not a New England thing; rather, its popularity may radiate out from Boston rather than be spread, creamily, around the region.

Alas, I do not have vast survey resources at my disposal.
What can I measure to proxy Fluffernutter demand?
Sales of peanut butter and specifically marshmallow creme are hard to find, so that's out.
What if I tried to take the [*New York Times*' Thanksgiving specialty route]() and use Google searches?
The *Times* measured the per capita rate of searches for different Thanksgiving side dishes and compared them to see which occurred above the national average.

This problem is a bit different than Thanksgiving side dishes because of the simplicity of the recipe.
People searching for `green bean casserole` or `frog-eye salad` are likely searching for a recipe for a dish they cook once a year.
The Fluffernutter spells out the recipe in its name (assuming you know what marshmallow fluff is).
I suspect that searches for `fluffernutter` would actually be by people who want to know what it is rather than those who know what it is.
Honestly, this problem makes Google search metrics a poor way to measure Fluffernutter demand but what else can I try?

I actually stopped here and asked Copilot for some help:

*I want to measure how familiar people are with the Fluffernutter sandwich. What are some publicly available datasets that may help answer this question?*

>Here are some publicly available datasets and data sources you could use to estimate familiarity with the Fluffernutter sandwich:
>
>1. Google Trends: lets you compare the popularity of search terms like "fluffernutter" by region and over time. You can export the data for analysis.
>
>2. Twitter/X API or Academic Research: Search for tweets mentioning "fluffernutter" and analyze their geographic metadata (if available). The Twitter API or datasets from Academic Research can help.
>
>3. Reddit Data: Use Pushshift Reddit Dataset or Reddit API to search for posts/comments mentioning "fluffernutter" and analyze subreddit/geographic context.
>
>4. Google Books: Ngram Viewer can show the frequency of "fluffernutter" in published books over time, which may indicate cultural familiarity.
>
>5. Survey Data: The General Social Survey (GSS) or Pew Research Center sometimes include food/culture questions, though "fluffernutter" is unlikely to be directly mentioned. You could look for broader food familiarity questions.
>
>6. YouGov or Statista sometimes publish survey results about food preferences and regional specialties.
>
>7. Google Books/Scholar, News Archives: Search for regional mentions in news archives or Google Scholar for academic studies on regional foods.
>
>8. Wikipedia Pageviews: Wikimedia REST API can provide pageview stats for the "Fluffernutter" article, which can be broken down by country.

On a lark, I tried some options besides Google Trends:

- Wikipedia, my darling, only breaks stats down to the country-level.
- Reddit requires being a moderator to use
- Twitter doesn't even have an Academic Research access level anymore ðŸ˜¬

Google Books' Ngrams did yield some insight into the fluffernutter's spread.
In addition to `fluffernutter`, I searched `liberty sandwich` in reference to its origins.
Shortly after the original fluffernutter recipe was created, we plunged into World War I;

>Americans were urged to give up meat one day a week. Peanut butter and fluff sandwiches, cut into dainty shapes, made a virtue out of necessity.
>
>What this means is that Melrose may very well be the birthplace of the what later came to be known as the Fluffernutter sandwich.
>
>--[*The Melrose Mirror*](https://web.archive.org/web/20171102063239/http://melrosemirror.media.mit.edu/servlet/pluto?state=303034706167653030375765625061676530303269643030353133343838)

Sure enough, mentions of `liberty sandwich` predate `fluffernutter` and find their first usage around the start of World War I.

As I expected, the Google Trends data was the best.
Using it, I could break searches down below the state level into the metro level.
Beyond satisfying my interest in defining New England according to [the Federal Reserve district](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Boston_Fed_map.png)---which I hold is the most accurate definition of the region---disaggregating data to the metro level allows us to see past trends at the state level.
