The camera moves from this fixed position exactly once to zoom in on the telephone.](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/04/18/lynchrabbits1024_wide-81b3911888e86e687da1a0370b19cc026967ef0d.jpg)\n\nBut there is nothing substantive about *Rabbits*: Lynch's mastery over cinematic cliché is taken to the brink, and over.\nIn many Lynch films since *Blue Velvet*, characters utter non-sequiters in total deadpan; but in *Rabbits*, they utter nothing but non-sequiters, with no story to speak of!\nThis Baldametti score then adds style to substanceless grunts, sounds English speakers will recognize as words but not as meaningful sentences.\nAnd with some serious hilarity, Lynch adds a sitcom applause over the entrances of each character into this one-room apartment and laughtracks after sentences like \"It is 7pm\" and \"I almost forgot.\" \nThese outbursts, audio cues to at-home viewers that Important or Funny happenings are taking place, mock TV shows like the *Big Bang Theory*, whose live audiences treat academic jargon and references to comic books as the basis for side-splitting guffaws.\n\nThe distance between the intelligibility of plot in *Rabbits* and the connotations of its audio cues emphasize the contingency of language and the ability of convention to invent meaning from nothing.\nIt is indisputable that Baldametti's score is ominous, alerting viewers that Something Is Happening, or that audience laughter is comedic, alerting viewers that a Joke Is Occurring.\nBut simply because a connotation is indisputable does not make it true.\nNone would dispute the scores ominousness or the audiences laughter because the years of TV and film that we have watch have taught us to connect certain sounds to certain moments.\nThe work starts with children's tales, where morality is stark and the audio cues used to reinforce a grand, unified message.\nBy grounding these otherwise unintelligible cues in extra-cinematic morality or realistic emotions, we learn to couple low, industrial sounds with alertness, and human laughter with comedy.\n*Rabbits* attempts to elicit those emotions by only employing the signifier, while ditching the plot points signified.\n\n![The *Persona*-like dream sequences. Nothing says for sure these rabbits sleep, but shifts in color and a demonic face that hovers in the upper left-hand corner match dream sequences in Lynch's other films.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NiOx5yJx-jc/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\nPerhaps one can argue that the words which immediately precede and follow the *Persona*-like interpolated dream sequences are Important, but I am not convinced.\nI propose that *Rabbits* is David Lynch toying with us.\nHe wants to know if he can make pure entertainment, works without useful or familiar stories, but which nonetheless strap us into rollercoasters of joy, despair, nostalgia, and humor.\nIn his other works, this plays out seamlessly.\nI (the viewer) achingly try to pin down the plot, and then the meaning of the narrative he created.\nThis process feels possible, but always out-of-reach in his other works, which ditch the rabbit heads and opt for sequences of dialog that I recognize as events and narrative momentum.\nBut in *Rabbits*, the dissonance between signifier and signified makes the effect clear.\nIn *Rabbits*, the laughter and music become parodic, pointing at the fact that in *all* language, cinematic or otherwise, our grunts are intelligible for no reasons other than Pavolvian repitition and the magic fizz of neurons.\nLanguage is contingent, subject to chance mutation and adoption, and not subject to deep structures or extra-personal validity.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":"morph","title-block-banner":true,"title":"David Lynch is Toying With Us","author":"corey","date":"2020-02-15","categories":["film","analysis"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
