Just walk,\" Scottie replies)---are compared to Scottie, the results---freedom to break social norms, presumption of sexual interest---line up nicely.\nThis deepens one traditional interpretation, which would use Scottie's background as an investigator to explain why he feels empowered to breach other's privacy and put them on the defensive.\nXXX's analysis also places him in a long line of flâneurs.\n\nBecause my conclusion was compatible with Mulvey's and XXX's conclusions, I felt comfortable making such a grand claim.\nBut my argument relied on the audience coming to *Vertigo* with a lot of contextual information about Jimmy Stewart.\nAnd I was lazy by drawing my conclusion about America from Scottie's identity rather than the film's content.\n\nHere I want to argue that claim using the film's content.\nIn some ways, the argument mirrors my previous essay, only this time the subjects are the public spectacles that Scottie takes in---the Golden Gate, John Muir Forest, and the mission-turned-museum San Juan Bautista---while the objects are the pre-American terrors those spectacles harnessed---the San Francisco Bay, towering redwoods, and the heights of the Mission San Juan Bautista.\nTo put it all together, I claim that modern man failed to tame San Francisco.\nThe idea of modern man is intricately tied to the flâneur.\nXXX's analysis posits the flâneur as a consumer of public space, which was produced for him.\nBut, while XXX considered the fact that these were produced, she did not consider the production itself.\n\nFor that we need YYY's *American Technological Sublime*.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":"morph","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Maybe I will put Vertigo to rest after this post","author":"corey","date":"2021-03-28","draft":true,"categories":["essay","film","analysis"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
