When you make a résumé template, you enjoy the benefit of other's learning all about you.]\nAn important, practical change was the substitution of ligatures and other glyphs for unicode symbols.\nApplicant-tracking systems struggle with LaTeX documents because of these features, though it pains me to remove them.\nI'm also keeping the same fonts throughout, a habit from my own yearbook days that is compatible with the minimalist, quiver-of-one idealism that I'm bringing to this whole endeavor.\nNaturally, the fonts must be open-source, so I'm using Adobe's [Source Sans Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans) and [Source Code Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Pro).^[You may have noticed I've changed this blog's typeface from IBM Plex to Source; I've learned from this process that IBM Plex is a bit too IBM-er for me.]\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/SourceSansPro-sample.svg)\n\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Source_Code_Pro_-_sample.svg)\n\nSource typeforms\n:::\n\nDeveloping the résumé was easy enough, given how little I changed things:\n\n![My new résumé](\"resume.png\")\n\nThe cover letter was easy too; just remove the sections, add a signature, and, voilá!\n\n![Sample cover letter](\"letter.png\")\n\nThe business card?\nA little more involved.\nI found a [fantastic introduction](https://olivierpieters.be/blog/2017/02/11/designing-a-business-card-in-latex) to business cards in LaTeX, with a great little bit about designing a QR code linked to my own vCard (something that can be scanned easily if you keep such things in a transparent phone case)s.\nInitials add a bit of class to the whole affair, and doesn't carry a lot of consequences given how seldom they are used.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n![Business card front](biz-card_front.png)\n\n![Business card back](biz-card_back.png)\n:::\n\n\nLast, to make these even easier to edit, I created global options used across the media.\nThis allows users to change fonts, colors, and contact information without doing so for each document.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":["simplex","../../broadsheet.scss"],"title-block-banner":true,"title":"Stationery in LaTeX","author":"corey","date":"2022-04-03","categories":["code bits","id"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
