When we reverted to case-writing, a huge backlog of cases had to be prepped for publication.\nMany of these were years-old.\nThey neither shared common formatting nor common citations, and---because the cases were so old---the original authors had moved on to bigger and better things.\nWe needed to solve all the problems that come with a team distributed not only across space but also time.\n\nFor literal centuries, publications have solved this problem with style guides and time-consuming editing practices.\nHowever, these are only as strong as their enforcement.\nWithout savvy, patient editors and authors with hours to spare, editing for standardization rightfully takes a back seat to editing for clarity and content.\nA somewhat newer solution involves distributing Word templates that authors simply fill in, Mad-Libs style.\nBut again, you run into the problem of enforcement.\nThe first time a line breaks where you don't want it to, or you copy the source style along with the text, the Word template ceases to be *authoritative*.\n\nMoreover, for editors reviewing work years later, if citations aren't perfect or comprehensive, finding the original document can be a bear.\nThese systems do not *link the product to the process*.\nThey allow authors to keep \"two sets of books\": one, incomplete but well-formatted, that gets published; another, complete but unstructured, located somewhere without a link tracing to it.\nIn this way, Word documents---for all the ways they liberate formatting and track changes---are little different from plain paper.\nWe have had [ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) to [connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) product and process for years, but it is hard to generate buy-in.\nSome compromise between accessibility (plain-text editors aren't familiar to most) and utility (e.g. Markdown would be ideal) is usually required.\n\nOur compromise is the amazing reference manager [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org).\nIt builds citations using Citation Style Language ([CSL](https://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/primer.html)).\nCSL imposes it style in Word documents using fields (kinda like those used often for page numbers or automatically updating dates) that it controls.\nIn this way it is authoritative.\nZotero feeds it information stored in its desktop app.\nWhat you put in is put out on the page.\nIn this way it connects product to process: to create a correct and nice-looking bibliography requires citing throughout a document and inputting data correctly to Zotero, which is super easy to search and connects documents to their contexts on the web.\n\nCSL, is also open source, which means that we could configure a style to our liking.\nWhile we mostly like Chicago (author-date) style, I and another Research Associate updated it with some contextual information.\nI learnt this XML-like language and have been deploying it with Git.\nIt's my first experience developing software that people actually *use*.\nThis makes a huge difference!\nWorking with something that will be used in the future by end-users made me think several steps ahead to maintain forward- and backward-compatibility, and reminded me how much I enjoy solving problems.\n\nCheck out the code [here](https://github.com/runkelcorey/ypfs/blob/master/ypfs-mini.csl).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":["simplex","../../broadsheet.scss"],"title-block-banner":true,"title":"YPFS Citation Style Language","author":"corey","date":"2021-03-24","categories":["open data","YPFS","code bits"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
