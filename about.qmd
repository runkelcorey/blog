I am a Research Associate at the [Yale Program on Financial Stability](https://som.yale.edu/centers/program-on-financial-stability) based in New Haven, CT.
I author [case studies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=3264284) of government responses to financial crises.
This combines my interest in political economy with an opportunity to build my skills visualizing structured and unstructured data.
Off the clock, I climb, cycle, [watch movies made in bygone times](https://letterboxd.com/runkelcorey/), and [read histories of ideas and institutions](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112898051-corey-runkel).

Soon, I'll start as a Data Analyst at Kin + Carta.
I'm looking forward to growing in one of the most dynamic industries and doing work with such a clear outcome.
Eventually, I want to become a leader in digital transformation; organizations generate a ton of unused data and understanding that is key to making wise decisions.

Before Yale, I graduated from the University of Virginia, where I double majored in Political \& Social Thought and Economics.
I wrote a thesis estimating the impact of home price depreciation on voting outcomes, and worked briefly with the UVA School of Architecture to improve transit outcomes in central Virginia.
